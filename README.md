# multi-objective-approach-to-single-allocation-hub-median-problem

# This OPL (Optimization Programming Language) model solves the P-Median Problem, a classic facility location problem used in operations research. The goal is to determine the optimal locations for a limited number of facilities (warehouses) to minimize the total demand-weighted distance to customers.
